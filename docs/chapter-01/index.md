# Chapter 1: Foundations of Humanoid Robotics

## Introduction

Humanoid robots are machines designed to mimic human form and function. From Honda's ASIMO to Boston Dynamics' Atlas and Tesla's Optimus, these robots represent the cutting edge of physical AI systems.

### What You'll Learn

- Robot anatomical structure and degrees of freedom
- Sensor and actuator technologies
- Mathematical foundations: kinematics and dynamics
- Practical skills through hands-on exercises

### Prerequisites

- Basic physics (forces, motion)
- Linear algebra fundamentals
- Python programming basics

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** and describe the major anatomical components of humanoid robots
2. **Explain** the function and selection of sensors and actuators in humanoid systems
3. **Solve** basic forward kinematics problems for multi-link robot arms
4. **Understand** the difference between kinematics and dynamics

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

- Humanoid robots mimic human anatomy with degrees of freedom at each joint
- Sensors (cameras, IMUs, force sensors) provide perception; actuators (motors) enable motion
- Forward kinematics calculates end-effector position from joint angles
- Inverse kinematics solves for joint angles given desired position
- Dynamics accounts for forces, torques, and mass in robot motion
- Design involves trade-offs: weight vs strength, speed vs precision, cost vs capability
