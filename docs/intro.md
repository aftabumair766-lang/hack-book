# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Coursebook

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Coursebook** – a comprehensive, AI-driven academic resource designed to teach the principles and practices of embodied intelligence, humanoid robotics, and physical AI systems.

## About This Coursebook

This coursebook bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in the rapidly evolving field of Physical AI. It is designed for:

- **University students** (undergraduate and graduate) studying robotics, AI, or mechatronics
- **Academic researchers** exploring embodied intelligence and human-robot interaction
- **Professional robotics engineers** seeking to deepen their knowledge of modern robotics systems

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate in the physical world. Unlike virtual AI systems that exist purely in digital environments, Physical AI encompasses:

- **Embodied Intelligence**: AI that learns through physical interaction with its environment
- **Perception**: Sensing and interpreting the physical world through sensors
- **Motion & Control**: Planning and executing physical movements
- **Adaptation**: Learning from physical experiences to improve performance

### Why Physical AI Matters

The future of AI is not just in data centers and cloud platforms – it's in robots that can:

- Assist in healthcare and elderly care
- Work alongside humans in manufacturing
- Explore dangerous or remote environments
- Perform complex manipulation tasks
- Interact naturally with humans

## Coursebook Structure

This coursebook is organized into **6 core chapters**:

### Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI
